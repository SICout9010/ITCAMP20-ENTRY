### Preparing
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

Tbh, When I know I can't use library or framework i got nervous quite a bit since I always use framework to the point that i forgot basic of JavaScript(Pure) and CSS(Pure)

### Coding
I start with analysis how things work, what I want to do.
1. I first off start with code basic html.
2. thinking then code CSS.
3. thinking then code JavaScript.
4. Simplely went with How CSS Selector work again.
5. In javascript using QuerySelector with Selector.
6. Profit :D
7. Add Webhook API(took a bit to research but it was fun!)
